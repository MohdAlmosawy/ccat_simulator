## 📝 What is CCAT?

The **Criteria Cognitive Aptitude Test (CCAT)** is a popular pre-employment assessment used by many companies to evaluate a candidate's cognitive abilities. It measures skills such as problem-solving, critical thinking, attention to detail, and the ability to learn new information quickly. The test typically includes questions on verbal reasoning, math and logic, and spatial reasoning.

## 🌟 Why I Built This

While preparing for the CCAT, I noticed a lack of free, high-quality practice tools available online. To fill this gap, I created this basic web-based CCAT simulator. The goal is to help others practice and improve their cognitive skills by simulating the real exam environment.
